# TO-DO-App
This is a project I made for a JavaScript course on Alura LATAM, where I learned how to manipulate the DOM. 
Basically, this website is a to-do list "app" where you can add the tasks you want to complete adding the desired date and time. 
It works with local storage. 
Currently working on responsive layout for mobile.
