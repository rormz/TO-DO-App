# TO-DO-App 🚀
This is a project I made for a JavaScript course on Alura LATAM, where I learned how to manipulate the DOM. 
Basically, this website is a to-do list "app" where you can add the tasks you want to complete adding the desired date and time. You can add as many as you want, and also check them as completed or delete them.
It works with local storage. This means the tasks you add will remain there even if you refresh the page or close the browser.
Currently working on responsive layout for mobile. 👩‍💻📲
